## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Current Sprint: File Opening & Editor Integration** 🚧
**Goal**: Complete the editor foundation with file opening and syntax highlighting
**Timeline**: Start immediately after QuickOpen completion ✅ 
**Next Components to create**:
```
src/components/editor/
├── FileOpener.tsx            // Handle file selection and opening
├── SyntaxHighlighter.tsx     // Code highlighting component  
├── EditorPane.tsx            // Main code editing area
├── useFileOpening.ts         // File opening logic hook
├── useEditorState.ts         // Editor state management
└── index.ts                  // Clean exports
```

**Completed This Session**:
✅ QuickOpen (Ctrl+P) with recursive search
✅ Session-based file prioritization  
✅ Fuzzy search with highlighting
🚨 Arrow key navigation (documented for future fix)

### **Next Sprint: Advanced Editor Features**
**Goal**: Syntax highlighting, multiple tabs, and AI integration
**Timeline**: After file opening completion

### **Architecture Principles**:
✅ **Component-focused**: Each feature as focused components  
✅ **Hook-based logic**: Custom hooks for stateful operations  
✅ **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript coverage  
✅ **Performance**: Virtualization and debouncing where needed  
✅ **Accessible**: Keyboard shortcuts and screen reader support
