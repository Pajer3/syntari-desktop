## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Current Sprint: Project-Wide Search** 🚧
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive search functionality
**Timeline**: Start immediately
**Components to create**:
```
src/components/editor/search/
├── SearchPanel.tsx           // Main search UI panel
├── SearchInput.tsx           // Search input with options
├── SearchResults.tsx         // Results display component
├── SearchResult.tsx          // Individual result item
├── useProjectSearch.ts       // Search logic hook
├── useSearchHistory.ts       // Search history management
└── index.ts                  // Clean exports
```

### **Next Sprint: Multi-Tab Enhancements**
**Goal**: Improve tab management and split views
**Timeline**: After search completion
