## ðŸ“‹ Technical Notes

### File System Integration
All components are designed with mock implementations that can be easily replaced with real file system APIs:
- Tauri file system APIs for desktop app
- Node.js fs module for development
- Cloud storage APIs for enterprise features

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large directory structures
- Virtual scrolling for file lists
- Debounced search for responsive UI
- Efficient recent files management

### Security & Validation
- Path traversal protection
- File type validation
- Size limit enforcement
- Permission checking framework

## ðŸŽ¯ UX Improvements

### Current Directory Tracking
- **Smart directory awareness** - tracks where users are currently browsing
- **Visual breadcrumb indicator** in file explorer showing current location
- **Automatic file creation** in the current directory context
- **Dynamic path updates** as users navigate through folders

### Improved Default Behaviors
- **New File**: Creates in current browsed directory, not generic location
- **Save As**: Defaults to current file's directory, not project root
- **Visual indicators**: Clear path displays in all dialogs
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: More intuitive Save All (Ctrl+Alt+S)

### Professional Feedback
- Current directory display in file explorer
- Path indicators in dialog headers
- Better visual hierarchy for location information
- Context-aware default paths

This implementation provides a solid foundation for professional file management in the Syntari AI IDE, matching the quality and functionality expected from enterprise development tools.
